# Static Rod Model

This repository contains the Matlab codes for the publications:
"AN INTERACTIVE GUI FOR EXPLORING CANTILEVER BENDING THROUGH NONLINEAR ROD THEORY", by Muhammad Hassaan Ahmed Utkarsh Srivastava, Ranjan Das and Sachin Goyal, 2025, ASME IDETC.CIE2025. See [link](https://www.overleaf.com/project/67ce9f1a3f2d0bb77e847257) for text.

Organization is as follows:
1. 2D-App: Static rod model app code for planer deformation
2. 3D-App: Static rod model app code for 3-D deformation
3. Simulink Model: Simulink model for solving the 2D static equilibrium equations as a two-step initial value problem
